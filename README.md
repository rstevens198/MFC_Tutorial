# MFC_Tutorial
a tutorial I did on MFC

Thisa showcases making a simple form that can be used on windows. To create it I used Visual Studios 2015, MFC, and C++.


Click the button to add 1 to the count and hit the reset to change it back. move the sliders so t number and then click the time control sliders checkbox to make the sliders count down. the mouse echo displays the cordinates of the mouse when it moves and when you press the right or left button. The timer just displays how long you have been in the window.
